Who is my lucky friend?
You can copy the code and put it in python and then change your names!
Look This is where I put the names in my project : list1 = ["Personal data!", "Kevin", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!", "Personal data!"]
and depending on the amount of people you can change this code:  random_no = random.randint(0, 21) The zero is the first  "Personal data! " mentioned above and 21 is the last one so change 21 to whatever amount of people you have so let's say you have 30 people the the number you put is 29 see you take away 1 number from the total!
You can change colours if you want!
